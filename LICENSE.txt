âœ… Key things you can include in any README:
1. **Project name & description**  
2. **Features / functionality**  
3. **How to run or install**  
4. **Tech used**  
5. **Screenshots (optional)**  
6. **Contributing instructions**  
7. **License info**

If you want, I can **write a minimal, ready-to-copy README.md specifically for your JerseyStore project** that looks neat on GitHub. Do you want me to do that?
